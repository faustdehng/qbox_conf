  Elixir on raspberry 
  - a practice for remote control
  
# abstract
  This topic is used to demostrate that Elixir works fine on raspberry pi. I develop a generalized player on raspberry named QBox, and use Elixir to build the web server, and then, any web browser can control the product remotely. This system works fine, and, therefore, I think it is helpful for person who want to develop such application. Because this application almoust includes all functions of raspberry interfaces (besides GPIO), such as: wifi, bluetooth, touch screen, USB, database, voice, HDMI, so, it is a good practice to demostrate the ability about Elixir on raspberry. My goals in this talk are: 1) present it works, 2) appreciate to the forum, it is very helpful to me in developing, 3) announce a resource (me), I am glad to provide my experience to any person insterested.
