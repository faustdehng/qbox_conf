  Elixir on raspberry 
  - a practice for remote control
  
# abstract
  This topic is used to demonstrate that Elixir works fine on the raspberry pi. I develop a generalized player on raspberry named QBox, and use Elixir to build the web server, and then, any web browser can control the product remotely. This system works fine, and, therefore, I think it is helpful for a person who wants to develop applications alike. Because this application almost includes all features of raspberry interfaces (besides GPIO), such as wifi, Bluetooth, touch screen, USB, database, voice, HDMI, so, it is a good practice to demonstrate the abilities about Elixir on raspberry. My goals in this talk are: 1) present it works, 2) appreciate to the forum, it is very helpful to me in developing, 3) announce a resource (me), I am glad to provide my experience to any person interested.
