# abstract
  This topic is used for demostrate that Elixir works fine in raspberry pi. I develop a generalized player in raspberry, and use Elixir to build the web server, and then, any web browser can control the product. The system works fine, and, therefor, I think it is helpful for person who want to develop such application. Because the application almoust includes all functions of raspberry interfaces (besides GPIO), such as: wifi, bluetooth, touch screen, USB, database, voice, HDMI, so, it is a good exaamle to demostrate the Elixir and raspberry. My goals in this talk are: 1) demo it works, 2) appreciate to the forum, it is very helpful to me in developing, 3) announce a resource (me), I am glad to provide my experience to any person insterested.
